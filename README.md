# Mini_SQL_Engine
Developed a mini sql engine which will run a subset of SQL queries using command line interface 

DATA: table1.csv and table2.csv contains data

Dataset: CSV files with data (all integers and unique columns) "Metadata.txt" file which represents structure for each table

Queries: 
## Project:
1)select * from table1;
2)select col1,col2 from table2; 
## Aggregate Functions 
1)select max(col1) from table1; likewise for sum,average,min,count, 
## Distinct
1) select distinct col1,col2 from table1; 
 ## Where
 1)Select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where col1 = 10 AND col2 = 20; Likewise operators include "< , >, <=, >=, =". 
## Group By
Select col1, COUNT(col2) from table_name group by col1 Also,
In the group by queries, Sum/Average/Max/Min/Count can be used as aggregate functions. 
## Order By 
Select col1,col2 from table_name order by col1 ASC|DESC. Also,queries can have multiple columns in it

### Input file format:-
  roll_number.sh "SQL Query" 
### Output format:- 
  <Table1.column1,Table1.column2,... TableN.columnM> Row1 Row2 ....... RowN
